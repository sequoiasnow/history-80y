My name is Sequoia Snow, I am frontend web-developer and current Physics & Maths major 
at UC Santa Cruz. I specialize in building progressive web applications using reactjs,
but have been known to branch out before.

I'm pretty much your standard nerd, I've seen every episode of game of thrones, I do 
math for fun, I learn programming languages when I'm bored, and am known to enjoy building
robots and Tesla coils. If you'd like to know more, read on.
