# The Atomic Bomb

This is a brief project made using the great presentational abilities of 
the fibonachi spiral. The inspiration of this design comes from Nick Jones'
great personal website.

As for the technology, this website uses react, and typescript as well as 
jQuery for the mousehweel events. It was written from scratch, starting 
with an empty folder and building from there, sadly as deadlines crunched,
the format of the source code got increasingly messy, which I apologize for.

The main code for the spiral effect is in `src/Spira/index.tsx`. One problem
I've heard accounts of is it is somehow zoomed in on some versions of chrome,
an interesing phenomenon I do not yet know how to account for, but am currently
working on. The uglyness of the main folder is due to the ease of use this provided
with github pages, I apoligize for this.
